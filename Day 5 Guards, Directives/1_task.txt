	display add button with every product which will add the product to cart
	make button visible only where user is logged in else no button

	service name : productservice 
3. ProductManagement
	addproduct (form - which will submit data to .ts and ts will call the sevice mehod)
	deleteproduct
	editproduct
4. Cart -- this will have a  array object which will display the products in card and display the cart value

home is free, productlist is free
productmanagement is only admin (username is 'ProductAdmin' and password is 'productadmin@434355')
		if this is valid then only can give access to productmanagemnet

cart is accessible to all the users which are valid - lets have a user, username = 'Nikhil' password='P@3458'
	then only allow access to cart
