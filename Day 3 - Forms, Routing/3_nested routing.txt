				--Nested Routing--

	1. Create a new application - shoppingAPP
	2. in the app folder, create below folder structure
			Components
				male (this is folder not component) - have below components
					malehome -- just display a image - 100px - 100px
					Clothing
					Accessories
					Shoes
				female (this is folder not component)- have below components
					femalehome -- just display a image - 100px - 100px
					Clothing
					Accessories
					Shoes
				kids (this is folder not component)- have below components
					kidshome -- just display a image - 100px - 100px
					clothing
					Toys
					shoes
				userprofile - This is a folder					
					userhome - display a message - feature coming soon in h1
					payment (this is a folder) - below are compoennts in payment
					        paymenthome - display a message - feature coming soon in h1
						CreditCard  (component)
						UPI (component)
						NetBanking
						Wallet	
				cart - this is a component 
					display a message - feature coming soon
		3. create and configure routes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
	 1.Parameterised routing

		we will want to display list of products on many components

		male clothing will have list of products in a table


		PId  pName pcategoty price discount offerprice

		page gets full already with this many information
		and so we are not able to display
		image, descriptions, advantages, dilevery info, price breakup, manufacturing info etc..
		
		thus what can be done as well is
		user can click on Pid or pName, 
			we take that id and navigate to a new component - productDetails
			where we show lot of information about the product
			Thus we will do parameter routing

	   2. user cannot activate userprofile, payment, cart if user is not logged in 
		we have a concept - Guards which will stop user to access the routes if they are not authenticated

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Thus in the same application let us have the setup ready 
		1. in the male, female and kids component 
			under clothing
			      accessories
			     shoes
			for all the 9 components, add a json array object
				productdetails = [{
			pId:101, pName:, pCategory,pPrice,pIsInStock
		}]			

		display 3 product on each catagegory of male, female and kids


		2. create a component productdetails, we will use this to display the products details
			
		3. create a component Login, with UI of username and password
