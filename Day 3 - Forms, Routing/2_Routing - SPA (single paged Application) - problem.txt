Routing - SPA (single paged Application)
-----------------------------------------------
Problem

A web page is made up of many pages
	Home, about, contact, news, careers, login, register 
	all this are pages

A single page is made up of many files
	.js file (multiple)
	.css file (multiple)
	.jpg file
	.png file
	etc....
Thus when a user is requesting for a page, browser makes multiple roundtrips to server to get the files
This is slowing the page render - lets say home page had 6 files, so total request are 7

From home user went to contactus page, which again had 5 files, out of which 2 files were already same in home page, so browser will not go for the same, it will pick it from cache

Now the problem is, if users wants to go back to home page, it will make 7 request again
on laptops and desktops lots of files are saved in cache, thus it will make request for files again only 
	when cache is cleared 

but the problem is with users not on desktop/laptop
Phones have limited memory for cache, users habbit are to clean and clear the cache many times in a day
in such a case there will be roundtrips again, which slows down the rendering, consuming more user data

--also if user gets disconnected from internet, none of the page will work

------------However in angular we have a concept of routing, which will not do roundtrips
	we create a single page for all the app information in a form of components

	Navigaion between pages will be internal in the browser, it will connect to server only to refresh 	the data

Else whole website is a single page (which contains all the components)
